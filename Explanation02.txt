Being able to change the value of a variable is useful because the values can be changed if needed. 
It also helps the user to do further calculations when needed. However, it can also be a source of problems
especially when the user forgets the changes made and when they might need the previous value entered.
Thus, can lead to wrong results in their calculations.
